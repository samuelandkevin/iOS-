"bBT" = "BBT";
"bBTDescription" = "Basal Body Temperature (BBT) is your body temperature at rest and can only accurately be taken immediately when you wake up. BBT rises after ovulation, due to increased progesterone released from the corpus luteum after ovulation. Ovulation can be detected on a BBT chart as the day or two before BBT rises.
 
 Take your temperature at the same time everyday, BEFORE you get out of bed, eat, drink or speak.";
"ovulationTests" = "Ovulation Tests";

The test normally will show a positive result when the LH surge and peak are occurring. If a test line is as dark or darker than the control line, it is considered a “positive” result, and the app will start looking for your surge as you get close to this. A positive result doesn’t always mean you are going to ovulate in 24-48 hours, it’s important to keep testing until you see a definitive peak day. To help confirm ovulation using a tool like BBT can be a great pairing with ovulation tests.
 
Aim to test any time in the early afternoon to early evening from 11:00AM - 4:00PM, as this is when LH level tends to be highest, and you will be less likely to miss peak.";
"cervicalMucus_CM" = "Cervical Mucus (CM)";
"cMDescription" = "Cervical mucus changes throughout the month, dependent on the hormones that are present. When your body nears its fertile window, estrogen levels spike to trigger ovulation. With this increase in estrogen, your cervical mucus also changes! Dry is infertile, wet is potentially fertile, and egg white cervical mucus (EWCM) is ideal for fertility.
 
 You may already be tracking cervical mucus, noticing raw egg-white consistency, creamy, sticky or dry by the feel of your fingers. This gives us essential clues to our fertile window; the egg-white cervical fluid that is present right before ovulation is our best indicator for fertility.";
"cervicalPositionFerning" = "Cervical Position & Ferning";

When first beginning to observe the cervix, be patient and focus on comparing each day to the day before. It can sometimes take a few cycles to get to know your cervix!";

Try to get to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.";
"weight" = "Weight";
"weightDescription" = "Being overweight or underweight can affect your fertility. You have a greater chance of getting pregnant if you have a healthy weight. Overweight women are more likely to have irregular menstrual cycles, reducing pregnancy rates. Even a small amount of weight loss can improve fertility and pregnancy health.
 
Having a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly are sensible approaches for boosting fertility and improving your chances of getting pregnant. Consult with your medical professional if you would like guidance and assistance with reaching your ideal weight.";
